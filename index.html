        <h1 class="HEADING v-h1">A brief story of my life</h1>
        <img class="AVATAR u-float-left" src="./img/profile.jpg" alt="photo of me">
        <p>I absolutely love creating things and seeing them come to life. It's magical. And there's nothing like the thrill of overcoming a big challenge. You can see why <strong>I love programming.</strong></p>
        <p>I've met this passion of mine when I was a kid,<strong> around 11 years old, </strong>when I started to develop games in RPG Maker - a program for creating jrpgs - learning every single tool in the software. <strong>Although it was visual scripting, everything was there</strong>: if clauses, loops, local and global scopes, objects, and many other things. <strong>The programming logic was the first logic I knew.</strong> This was also when I learned a lot of English on my own, using a physical dictionary, since I didn't have internet connection back then.</p>
        <p>I have strayed from the path for many years, worked in many other areas, most notably as a high school tutor, and accumulated experience with different things.<strong> When the pandemics hit and left me unemployed, I saw it as an opportunity to get back to programming, my true passion, and so I did.</strong> I have been very dedicated to learning it since then, both by myself, through courses, guides, documentation and experimentation, and by later entering the rapidly growing <a href="https://www.betrybe.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Trybe</a> programming school back in March.</p>
        <p>Currently, <strong>I'm working as a Frontend Developer</strong> at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/estudiosflow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Estúdios Flow</a>, which is the studio behind <a href="https://www.youtube.com/flowpodcast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Flow Podcast</a>, one of the largest podcasts in Brazil, with <strong>over 3 million subscribers on YouTube</strong>. We're working on tons of improvements for the platform, and I've been coding with <strong>Next, React and TypeScript.</strong></p>

        <h1>I <strong>love</strong> gaming</h1>
        <h2>And I'm also very competitive</h2>
        <p>I've been playing since ever. And I've always enjoyed playing challenging games. I love theorycrafting builds, <strong>creating strategies</strong> and trying different things.</p>
        <p>I've played many games in a semi-competitive manner, such as mythic raids in WoW, high tier Yu-Gi-Oh in the days of Dueling Network.</p>
        <p>And, of course, <strong>League of Legends</strong>. I've started back in Season 2, on the Syndra patch. I've hit Gold in Season 3 and <strong>Diamond in Season 4</strong>.</p>
        <p>I have since then been on and off LoL, while playing other games, but recently I played a lot of LoR and really enjoyed it.</p>
        <p>I haven't been playing much lately because I'm working AND studying on a very intense bootcamp but I most definitely will play more again when I finish the course.</p>

        <h1>I'm a problem solver</h1>
        <p><strong>I cherish a good challenge.</strong> Truly, I am <em>driven</em> by challenges. I seek them, and I treasure facing them.</p>
        <p>This makes me a good problem solver. I have many tactics for tackling problems, but mostly <strong>I always break them in smaller pieces</strong> - I analyze them, create solutions, then create problems for the solutions, and work iteratively until I come up with a solution that will really crack it.</p>
        <p>My early contact with programming <strong>allows me to see the world critically</strong>, and I always try to simplify my solutions to make them as elegant as possible.</p>

      <section class="u-wrapper">
        <h1>I'm also a people person</h1>
        <p>I'm really sociable. I truly enjoy talking about anything, and I enjoy a good informal ambient. <strong>I work hard, but I also like to chill</strong>, and to play hard.</p>
        <p>Thanks to my previous career as a high school tutor, <strong>I'm communicative, and I'm always open to give and receive feedback.</strong> I can be perfeccionist at times, but I'm working on that.</p>

        <h1>I learn really, really fast</h1>
        <p>I know everyone says that, but I do have a true knack for it.</p>
        <p>I have also <strong>extensively studied the art of learning</strong>, also thanks to my previous career as a tutor, and I wrote a brief scientific article on a method of revision.</p>

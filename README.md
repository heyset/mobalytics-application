# mobalytics-application
Simple HTML and CSS page created to apply for a job as a Frontend Developer at Mobalytics

## What is this repo about?
It's my cover letter/resum√©/application for Mobalytics. It's a simple HTML + CSS page, no libraries.

It's currently deployed to GitHub Pages and you can check it out [here](https://heyset.github.io/mobalytics-application/).

## How can I use it?
If you're a recruiter at Mobalytics, you can read it, check out the code and take the opportunity to explore my GitHub as well, in order to consider me for the position.

I'm afraid there's not much use for this repo if you're not actively recruiting for Mobalytics, though you could read it to get to know me a bit more. :)

## How can I contribute?
Since this is not being actively developed (apart from maybe a fix or another that may arise), there's not much to be done in terms of development. But you can definitely make suggestions.
